=head1 NAME

NCarton::Doc::Install - Install the dependencies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cartone install [--deployment] [--cached] [--path=PATH] [--without develop]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Install the dependencies for your application. This command has two
modes and the behavior is slightly different.

=head2 DEVELOPMENT MODE

=over 4

=item cartone install

If you run C<cartone install> without any arguments and if I<cpanfile>
exists, cartone will scan dependencies from I<cpanfile> and install
the modules.

=back

If you run C<cartone install> for the first time
(i.e. I<cpanfile.snapshot> does not exist), cartone will fetch all the
modules specified, resolve dependencies and install all required
modules from CPAN.

If I<cpanfile.snapshot> file does exist, cartone will still try to install
modules specified or updated in I<cpanfile>, but uses I<cpanfile.snapshot>
for the dependency resolution, and then cascades to CPAN.

cartone will analyze all the dependencies and their version
information, and it is saved into I<cpanfile.snapshot> file. It is important
to add I<cpanfile.snapshot> file into a version controlled repository and
commit the changes as you update your dependencies.

=head2 DEPLOYMENT MODE

If you specify the C<--deployment> command line option or the
I<cpanfile.snapshot> exists, cartone will only use the dependencies
specified in the I<cpanfile.snapshot> instead of resolving
dependencies.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --deployment

Force the deployment mode. See L</"DEPLOYMENT MODE"> above.

=item --cached

Locate distribution tarballs in C<vendor/cache> rather than fetching
them from CPAN mirrors. This requires you to run C<cartone bundle>
prior to the deployment and commit or sync the content of C<vendor>
directory to the other host you run C<cartone install> on.

=item --cpanfile

Specify the alternate path for cpanfile. By default, C<cartone install>
will look for the file C<cpanfile> in the current directory, then
upwards till the root directory, in case the command runs from a sub
directory.

NCarton assumes the directory where your cpanfile (or altenate path)
exists as a project root directory, and will look for the snapshot file as
well as install directory (C<local>) and C<vendor/cache> relative to it.

=item --path

Specify the path to install modules to. Defaults to I<local> in the
directory relative to where C<cpanfile> is.

B<NOTE>: this option, as of version 1.0, is not preserved across
multiple runs of C<cartone install> or other commands such as C<cartone
list> or C<cartone exec>. You can choose to set the path in
C<PERL_CARTON_PATH> environment variable to persist it across
commands.

=item --without

By default, C<cartone install> will install all the phases for
dependencies, including C<develop>. You can specify phases or features
to exclude, in the comma separated list.

  cartone install --deployment --without develop

B<NOTE>: C<--without> for the initial installation (without
cpanfile.snapshot) is not supported at this moment.
