=item *

C<carton exec -Ilib> is deprecated. You must pass the optional include
path to perl interpreter in the normal way, like:

  carton exec perl -Ilib myscript

Or make your script to take its own C<-I> option, like many command line
launcher does (i.e. plackup, prove)

  carton exec plackup -Ilib myapp.psgi

=item *

cpanfile is now a requirement, and extracting requirements from build
files (C<Makefile.PL>, C<Build.PL>) is not supported.
