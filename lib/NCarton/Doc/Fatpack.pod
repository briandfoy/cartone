=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cartone fatpack

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING>: It is known for this command to create an executable that
is not sufficient to run standalone in some environments, especially
when L<local::lib> is enabled. It is recommended to use the standard
C<cpanm> command to install bundle created by C<cartone bundle>
command. See C<carton -h bundle> for more details.

This command creates a fatpack executable of C<cartone> in
C<vendor/bin> directory, so that it can be used to bootstrap
deployment process, combined with C<cartone bundle> and C<cartone
install --cached>.
